#Get into Teaching API - V1

# Provides a RESTful API for integrating with the Get into Teaching CRM. The Get into Teaching (GIT) API sits in front of the GIT CRM, which uses the [Microsoft Dynamics365](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/) platform (the [Customer Engagement](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/developer/overview) module is used for storing Candidate information and the [Marketing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/marketing/developer/using-events-api) module for managing Events). The GIT API aims to provide: * Simple, task-based RESTful APIs. * Message queueing (while the GIT CRM is offline for updates). * Validation to ensure consistency across services writing to the GIT CRM.
