#Get into Teaching API - V1

#  Provides a RESTful API for integrating with the Get into Teaching CRM.    The Get into Teaching (GIT) API sits in front of the GIT CRM, which uses the [Microsoft Dynamics365](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/) platform (the [Customer Engagement](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/developer/overview) module is used for storing Candidate information and the [Marketing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/marketing/developer/using-events-api) module for managing Events).    The GIT API aims to provide:    * Simple, task-based RESTful APIs.  * Message queueing (while the GIT CRM is offline for updates).  * Validation to ensure consistency across services writing to the GIT CRM.

  # unit tests for add_mailing_list_member
  # Adds a new member to the mailing list.
  # If the &#x60;CandidateId&#x60; is specified then the existing candidate will be added to the mailing list, otherwise a new candidate will be created.  Validation errors may be present on the &#x60;MailingListAddMember&#x60; object as well as the hidden &#x60;Candidate&#x60; model that is mapped to; property names are consistent, so you should check for inclusion of the field in the key when linking an error message back to a property on the request model. For example, an error on &#x60;UkDegreeGradeId&#x60; can return under the keys &#x60;Candidate.Qualifications[0].UkDegreeGradeId&#x60; and &#x60;UkDegreeGradeId&#x60;.
